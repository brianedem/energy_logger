Energy Logger Notes

A database table is used to log daily energy consumption/production/import/export
measured by a variety of devices.

Measurement devices include:
    - Peacefair via pico W web server
    - solarEdge via modbus/TCP network connection

Devices monitored include:
    - solar production
    - home utility export
    - home utility import
    - HVAC condenser consumption
    - HVAC evaporator consumption

The database table includes the end-of-day date of the measurement (primary key) and a column for each
measurement. Null values are used for readings that failed or have not yet been implemented.

All measurements are in kWh.

- Measurements from the Piecefair device are made using the pp-read.py application.
- Measurements from the solarEdge inverter are made using th sEdge.py application.
