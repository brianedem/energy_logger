Energy Logger Notes

A database table is used to log energy consumption/production/import/export
cumlative meter readings

Measurement devices include:
    - Peacefair PZEM-004T via pico W configured as a web server
    - SolarEdge via modbus/TCP network connection

Devices monitored include:
    - solar production
    - home utility export
    - home utility import
    - HVAC condenser consumption
    - HVAC evaporator consumption
    - waterheater consumption

The database table includes the end-of-day date of the measurement (primary key) and a column for each
measurement. Null values are used for readings that failed or have not yet been implemented.

All measurements are in kWh.

- Measurements from the Piecefair device are made using the pp-read.py module.
- Measurements from the SolarEdge inverter are made using th sEdge.py module.
